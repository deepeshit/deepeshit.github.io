            <p>There is a kind of cruelty that doesn’t scream. It doesn’t bruise. It doesn’t even necessarily announce itself with the theatrical flair of heartbreak. No, the cruelty I speak of is a slow, dull throb — like a clock ticking in a dark room, indifferent to your insomnia. This is the violence of detaching from someone you were once inseparably, unbearably tethered to — an emotional phantom limb that aches long after its departure.</p>
            <p>To unlove someone — or to pretend to — is to perform a kind of self-lobotomy. You don’t know which part of your psyche will be left bleeding on the operating table, but you pick up the scalpel anyway.</p>
            
            <p><h3>“I am in chains. Don’t touch my chains.” — Franz Kafka</h3></p>
            <p>I have found myself at the corner of Kafka and Sylvia — a place where the soul seems perpetually exiled from its own body, watching, distant and disembodied, as it fails to stop dialing a number it has long since deleted.</p>
            <p>Some people move through us like ink spilled on an old letter — bleeding through every layer, staining even the subtext of who we are. You can try to dry it, try to erase it with rational thought or distraction, but the parchment is changed forever. You are changed forever.</p>
            <p>And yet, every night, you convince yourself you can undo it — as if attachment were a kind of emotional Velcro that can be peeled apart cleanly. But the truth is far more grotesque. Real attachment doesn’t tear away — it seeps out. It decays. It rots in the corners of your thoughts and leaks into dreams like black mold through the drywall of consciousness.</p>

            <p><h3>The Paradox of Memory</h3></p>
            <p>There is no “delete” button for memories. No amount of logic or mental hygiene can extinguish the smell of their shirt, the cadence of their voice, the tiny pauses they take before saying something they think might matter. These things — these absurdly specific things — are the most stubborn.</p>
            <p>Dostoevsky wrote that “pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.” I’ve clung to this line like a lifeboat, trying to convince myself that my misery is some unholy sign of emotional depth. But what if it’s just dysfunction in an expensive suit? What if I’m not wise, just broken?</p>
            <p>Trying to remove someone from your emotional system is like trying to take the “rose” out of “sorrow” — and expecting the word to still mean anything.</p>

            <p><h3>Love as Psychosis</h3></p>
            <p>No one talks about how attachment feels like psychosis. You hear their voice in crowds. You feel their imagined judgment when you try to laugh at something without them. You craft internal monologues in their voice. It’s less like losing someone and more like being haunted by the ghost of a living person.</p>
            <p>There are days when I open my phone just to not text them. I compose entire messages and erase them — a ritual I perform like a monk whipping his own back. Because that pain, at least, feels honest.</p>
            <p>Sylvia Plath once said, “I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: I am, I am, I am.” But now, even that feels like a lie. My heart doesn’t brag. It begs. It keens. It knocks at a door that is now wallpapered over by time and distance.</p>

            <p><h3>Digital Ghosts</h3></p>
            <p>Technology has made detachment a farce. You can’t move on when their social media still echoes your shared past back at you in algorithmic cruelty. You see the outlines of their new life, their curated smiles, the meals they’re eating without you, the books they’re reading, the people who are not you, who now have access to their laughter.</p>
            <p>You keep watching. You become a digital voyeur of your own irrelevance.</p>
            <p>The worst part is that you know it’s bad for you — that you are the architect of your own torment. But you still open the app. Still type their name. Still hurt yourself.</p>
            <p>Because the alternative — true forgetting — feels like murder. Who would you be if you let them go completely? Would it not be a kind of suicide? The quiet killing of the version of you that only existed in relation to them?</p>

            <p><h3>Emotional Withdrawal is a Death</h3></p>
            <p>Withdrawal from a person is more violent than withdrawal from any substance. There’s no rehab for love. No cold turkey. You either suffer or you suffer differently. The world offers you every anaesthetic except the one you need — their presence.</p>
            <p>I’ve tried the usual prescriptions: distance, distraction, journaling, mindfulness. But they’re all polite rituals in the church of denial. At best, they soften the edges. At worst, they feel like gaslighting myself into a wellness I haven’t earned.</p>
            <p>Every moment without them is both relief and injury. It is like being on fire and freezing at the same time — your skin cracking from both extremes. There is no room for moderation in this kind of pain. It is all-encompassing. It metabolizes your entire emotional bandwidth.</p>

            <p><h3>“It is better to be with someone who cheats on you than to be alone.” — Fyodor Dostoevsky (The Idiot)</h3></p>
            <p>That line disturbed me when I first read it. Now, it just feels familiar. Because the truth is, detachment — real detachment — demands that you sit in a room with your worst fears and not blink. You must resist the urge to call, to text, to send a meme, to casually mention a shared memory — and instead let that intimacy rot in silence.</p>
            <p>You must become cruel with yourself — deliberate in your abandonment of the hope that they might come back. And that cruelty becomes your discipline.</p>
            <p>But I won’t lie: It’s killing me.</p>
            <p>Not in the cinematic, “I’m a mess, but I’ll get over it” kind of way. No. It’s slower. More Kafkaesque. Like waking up in a body that refuses to move, in a house where every object reminds you of what you lost, in a language where their name is a banned word.</p>

            <p><h3>The Ritual of Survival</h3></p>
            <p>I survive now in rituals. Reading Dostoevsky, Kafka, Plath. Drinking coffee that burns just enough to remind me I’m still here. Writing words that I will never send. Performing a kind of emotional exorcism every morning when I remember, again, that I must not reach out.</p>
            <p>I whisper “let them go” like a mantra, like an exorcist casting out a demon that doesn’t want to leave.</p>
            <p>It doesn’t get better. Not yet. It just gets different.</p>
            <p>Some nights I convince myself I’ve made progress. I go hours without thinking of them. I laugh. I write code. I even flirt with the idea of someone else.</p>
            <p>But then a scent, a song, a stray syllable, and I’m back in that old house of pain — a squatter in the ruins of my own longing.</p>
            <p>But that version died quietly — no obituary, no grave. Just this ghost in my chest that still whispers their name like a prayer. Or a curse.</p>
