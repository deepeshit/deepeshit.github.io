            <p>Birthdays are supposed to be milestones - quiet celebrations of survival, loud reminders of joy. But lately, they've felt more like unwelcome check-ins with a version of myself I keep trying to outrun. Today is my birthday, and I don't feel older so much as I feel further - further from where I thought I'd be, from the people I used to call home, from the dreams I once clutched to my chest like talismans. If life is a path, I must have taken too many wrong turns. Or maybe I stood still too long, hoping the world would circle back for me. It hasn't.</p>
            <p>There's a kind of ache that doesn't scream - it just lingers. Low-grade, steady, like a hum beneath the surface of everything. That's what my life has become lately. Not a disaster, but a slow erosion. Nothing dramatic. Just the quiet crumbling of things I thought would always be there - ambition, clarity, connection. I used to have a map. Now I don't even know what country I'm in.</p>
            <p>Failure has taken root in strange corners of my life. It didn't arrive all at once like I expected it would. There was no grand collapse, no thunderclap. Just a slow settling into mediocrity. Projects half-finished, opportunities missed, energy drained by self-doubt. I see people my age carving out space in the world, and I can't help but feel like I'm shrinking into mine. I was supposed to be someone by now. I don't even know who I am anymore.</p>
            <p>And then there's family - those complicated, flawed, necessary people who once felt like my anchor. These days, I don't know how to talk to them. Or maybe I just don't want to hear what they'd say if I did. Conversations with them feel like walking a tightrope made of eggshells. One wrong word and the tension shatters into silence or worse - passive disappointment. It's not that they don't love me. It's that I don't think they like me anymore. Maybe they never did, and I just didn't notice.</p>
            <p>There's an ever-growing distance between who I am and who they want me to be. I don't know how to bridge that. I'm tired of trying. Tired of defending myself. Tired of pretending I'm not unraveling inside when they ask how I've been. "Fine," I always say. "Busy." The universal language of avoidance. But behind those words is the truth I never let slip: I'm lost, and I don't think anyone's looking for me.</p>
            <p>The irony is that the older I get, the more invisible I feel. As a child, I thought adulthood would be a kind of triumph. I imagined confidence. Control. Stability. What I got instead is a parade of unanswered emails, unpaid bills, unopened dreams gathering dust in some forgotten drawer of my mind. I used to believe that time would sharpen me, polish the edges. But it hasn't. I feel dulled - worn down by decisions I made too late or didn't make at all.</p>
            <p>I know this reads like self-pity. Maybe it is. Maybe today is just a particularly loud day in my head. But I think there's something honest, something necessary, in admitting that life isn't always a gentle climb. Sometimes it's a series of stumbles. Sometimes birthdays don't feel like celebrations, but checkpoints you pass alone on a road you didn't mean to take.</p>
            <p>People say healing isn't linear. I don't even know if I've started healing. Mostly I've been surviving. Holding on to routine like it's a life raft. Smile here. Work there. Eat. Sleep. Wake. Repeat. Some nights I wonder if this is it - if this loop is all that's left. And then I hate myself for thinking that. Because I know people have it worse. Because I should be grateful. Because I'm still breathing. But even breath feels heavy when it's carrying disappointment.</p>
            <p>And yet, even in the bleakness, there's a flicker. Maybe not hope. Not yet. But awareness. The kind that whispers, You're still here. And sometimes, that's the most defiant thing we can say in a world that keeps asking us to disappear behind curated versions of ourselves. I may not be where I thought I'd be. I may be distant from the people who once held me close. But I haven't given up. Not fully. Not today.</p>
            <p>I don't expect cake or candles. I don't need well-wishes from people who haven't called in months. I just want to be honest with myself for once. To admit that I'm not okay, and that's okay. That maybe failure isn't permanent. That distance from family doesn't mean you've stopped loving them, only that loving them hurts right now. That maybe, just maybe, there's still time to make sense of this mess.</p>
            <p>So here's to this strange, sad, quiet birthday. A moment not of celebration, but of confrontation. A small pause to say: I'm still figuring it out. A reluctant toast to the lost years, the missed chances, the strained voices on the other end of the phone. A whispered promise that I won't stop trying, even if today all I manage to do is breathe.</p>
            <p>Happy birthday to me, I guess.</p>
